# University of Nanaimo Application Process

## Overview

This repository contains documentation and process models for the University of Nanaimo's student application and enrollment process. The process covers the entire journey from initial application submission to final enrollment confirmation.

## Process Description

The University of Nanaimo's application process involves several key stages:

1. **Application Submission**: Prospective students initiate the process by submitting an application form with personal information, program details, and supporting documents[1].

2. **Approval Process**: The application undergoes parallel reviews by the Academic Review Committee and Policy Compliance Office[1].

3. **Admissions Department Review**: Once approved, the application moves to the Admissions Department for validation[1].

4. **Registrar's Office and Financial Aid Office Review**: The application is simultaneously processed by these two departments[1].

5. **Faculty Advisor Assignment**: The Admissions Department assigns a faculty advisor based on the student's preference or available faculty[1].

6. **Financial Aid Processing**: The Financial Aid Office processes any financial aid applications and tuition payments[1].

7. **Acceptance and Enrollment**: Upon approval, an acceptance letter is generated and sent to the student. The Registrar's Office then verifies enrollment details and generates an enrollment confirmation[1].

8. **Tuition Payment**: The student submits tuition payments, which are processed by the Financial Aid Office[1].

9. **Final Enrollment Confirmation**: The process concludes with a final confirmation of the student's enrollment status[1].

## Process Model

The repository includes a comprehensive process model diagram (Process-Model.pdf) that visually represents the entire application and enrollment workflow. Key elements of the model include:

- Start and end events
- Activities performed by students and university departments
- Decision points and gateways
- Parallel processes
- Loops for document updates and payment resolution

## Implementation Notes

- The process involves multiple university departments, including Admissions, Registrar's Office, and Financial Aid Office.
- Some systems, such as the student information system and financial system, are not integrated, which may lead to manual reconciliation processes[1].
- The three-way match process in the Financial Aid Office can be time-consuming and may cause delays in financial clearance[1].

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for process improvement include:

1. Integration of the student information system and financial system to reduce manual reconciliation.
2. Streamlining the three-way match process in the Financial Aid Office to reduce delays.
3. Implementing automated notifications for students throughout the application process.
